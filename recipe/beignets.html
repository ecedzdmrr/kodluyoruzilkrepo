        <h1>Beignets Recipe</h1>
        <p>Traditional beignets are a fried French pastry, typically made from a pâte à choux, 
            which is an eggy batter that puffs and creates an airy inside. <br>
            Beignets now can be made from several different types of doughs, 
            and yeasted are the most common you'll find in New Orleans.</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
                In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. <br>
                In another large bowl, combine egg yolks, sugar, ¼ cup water, melted butter, <br>
                and vanilla and stir to combine. Fold into dry ingredients until just combined.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
                In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat egg whites on medium speed <br>
                until soft peaks form, then fold into batter.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
                In a large pot, heat oil to 375º. Drop small spoonfuls of batter into hot oil <br>
                and fry until golden, about 5 minutes. (You want to keep the oil at 375º <br>
                to make sure they cook all the way through.) Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>
                Dust with powdered sugar before serving.
