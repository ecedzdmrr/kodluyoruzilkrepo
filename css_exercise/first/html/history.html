                <h1>the History of the Terrarium</h1>
                <p>Terrariums have been around for many years, and have recently made a comeback in interior design <br>
                    trends. Available in a variety of shapes, styles and colors, the possibilities of homes for tiny
                    succulents <br>
                    or decorative gardens are endless. <br><br>
                    The original terrarium was invented by English botanist, Dr. Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward in 1842. <br>
                    He made the discovery of the terrarium by accident when he was raising moth pupa in a sealed glass
                    jar. <br>
                    Ward noticed that moss and ferns were thriving in the environment he had created for the moths. <br>
                    He decided to experiment more with placing plants that were not native to England in a similar
                    sealed <br>
                    glass and observed how the greenery thrived. After excessive experimentation, he wrote a short paper
                    <br>
                    about his discovery called 'The Growth of Plants Without Open Exposure to Air' followed by his book
                    <br>
                    'On the Growth of Plants in Closely Glazed Cases' both works published in 1842. <br><br>
                    The Wardian cases quickly become popular among the botanist of Britain and Europe. Wards <br>
                    discovery of the terrarium not only opened the gates for international botany, it also allowed
                    scientist <br>
                    to better understand different ecosystems and to observe plants, and small animals, <br>
                    in an environment closer to their natural ones. Before this discovery, it would take months of <br>
                    traveling and studying to accomplish.
